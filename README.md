# Holiday

You will need to create four functions:

    ● hotel_cost — This function will take the number of nights a user
    will be staying at a hotel as an argument, and return a total cost for
    the hotel stay (You can choose the price per night charged at the
    hotel).

    ● plane_cost — This function will take the city you are ﬂying to as an
    argument and return a cost for the ﬂight (Hint: use if/else if
    statements in the function to retrieve a price based on the chosen
    city).

    ● car_rental — This function will take the number of days the car will
    be hired for as an argument and returns the total cost of the car
    rental

    ● holiday_cost — This function will take three arguments: the
    number of nights a user will be staying in a hotel, the city the user
    will be ﬂying to and the number of days that the user will be hiring
    a car for. Using these three arguments, you can call all three of the
    above functions with respective arguments and ﬁnally return a
    total cost for your holiday.

Print out all the details about the holiday in a meaningful way!
